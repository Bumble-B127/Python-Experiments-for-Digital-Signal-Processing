# Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Experiments 

Welcome to my **Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Experiments** repository! 🚀 
This repository contains 9 experiments based on fundamental DSP concepts, implemented in Python.

## 📌 Repository Overview
I designed this repository to help students and enthusiasts understand and implement key DSP concepts through coding and visualization. Each experiment includes:
- A well-structured python script 📝
- Word document containing the code and ouput 🔍
- Sample input/output visuals 📊
- References to DSP textbooks 📚

## 🔬 Experiments List

| #  | Experiment Title                      | Description |
|----|--------------------------------|-------------|
| 2  | **Generation of Basic signals** | Generate basic signals (sine, cosine, square wave, exponential) and understand sampling. |
| 3  | **Operation of Signals** | Demonstrate basic signal operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication concepts and visualise in spectral domain. |
| 4  | **Convolution Sum** | Implement Convolution Operation using two signals. |
| 5  | **Computation of DFT and IDFT** | Compute the DFT for a given signal and reconstruct the signal using IDFT. |
| 6  | **Properties of DFT** | Simulate and explore the Circular Convolution property exhibited by DFT operation on signals. |
| 7  | **Effective Computation of DFT** | Perform FFT on a given input signal based on even and odd indexed separation to obtain the final results. |
| 8  | **Linear Filtering of Long Sequences** | Perform Over-Add-Convolve operation on a given signal and cross verify the obtained results with the in-built convolution function. |
| 9  | **FIR Filter** | Design an FIR low-pass filter for the given specifications, based on windowing technique using various windows such as Hanning, Hamming, Rectangular windows. |
| 10  | **IIR Filter** | Design an analog low-pass Butterworth filter for the given specifications , convert it into a digital filter and observe the Impuse response of the filter. |
